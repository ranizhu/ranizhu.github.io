{"name":"About Me","tagline":"Rani Zhu","body":"### About Me\r\nI'm Rani, a typical 16 year old teenage girl in high school. I am a senior attending Burton High School, residing in San Francisco, California. Next year I'll be heading off to college, so that is why I'm creating this portfolio, for the purpose of compiling all my work from the past and for future projects in AoAME. Some of my work will include shorts films and artwork. I hope you find inspiration looking through my work, and enjoy your visit!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
